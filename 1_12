AGENDA:

Notes:
---------

1) Ability to track engagement through users; whether it is natural on a user's end, or inspired through network intervention (promotions)

2) Location is still an issue; remove users who have not activated their profiles
	
	Colorado can be selected

3) Member type needds to be included (entrepranuer, startup, etc)

4) Future content that can be pulled from mentors on the site

5) How can we target users to fill out profiles about "resources I'm interested in"

6) Matching users who are experts to those who are looking for similar topics

7) How do we make direct connections between users with similar interests and expertises? A solution exists to this, but we need to know what it is.

8) Engagement score buckets - labelings users that fall under a level of engagement; we can possible track change of engagement over a certain period of time

9) Gather weekly reports and report rate of change for industries, interests, engagement, etc

10) Analyzing areas of locations and looking at the demographics that make up the people in the area

	Grouping by regions or counties

11) Look at users who are not in a group and try to suggest them to it

12) Suggest new groups to create based off demographics that have not been filled; if a hemp group foes not exist, we could suggest creating it and what users would be suggested to be included in it

13) Look into creating executable for MACS and PC
