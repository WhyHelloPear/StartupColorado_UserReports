1) Research job board functionality on hivebrite and give simple synopsis
	on what it takes to set it up, how it works with multiple users posting
	jobs (if they need to be admins or can anyone do it) and any potential
	limitations. Are there any 3P intergrations.
	
2) Clean up group reports further

3) Check to make sure "resources I'm interested in" are being selected for
	report
	
4) Set up location by county regions

5) Include user activity levels based on engagement score in pdf reports
	Activity will be based on 3 different levels; very active, somewhat active, and low active
		Bins must be created based on average engagement score on the site

6) Reduce redundancies within the reports where possible
		Merge similar industries and fields into a single category
		
7) Include a percentage of active and inactive users, along with number for each category

8) Look at users who are not in a group and try to suggest them to it - Audrey is currently adding new users to regional groups. Maybe a next stage could be direct outreach to new members and ask them about their expertise, interests, etcâ€¦? This could 1) prompt us to assign them to a group and 2) inspire them to complete their profile

9) View expertise by georegion to analyze where their strengths lie. We have this available for regional groups, is it worth breaking out a separate report for county or region not covered by group to view this? - Thoughts Taylor, Delaney?

10) Change in users from previous week - number of new users, their member type (cluster), anything else?
