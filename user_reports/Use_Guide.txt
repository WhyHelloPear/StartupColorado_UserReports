Group Cover Images and Logos
----------------------------
Each group has it's own cover image and logo that will be used 
on each respective group report. These images are stored in
'data/group_data/cover_photos' and 'data/group_data/logos'.
Each image, both cover photo and logo, will be saved with the
group's ID as its name. This format MUST ALWAUS REMAIN THE SAME
if the images are to be used for the reports.
