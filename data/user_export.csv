1211229,,,,SCHALLERT,,,JON,,,js@jonschallert.com,,,,,,,"Destination Business Expert, Professional Speaker & Consultant","Jon Schallert is the only professional speaker and business consultant teaching businesses and communities how to turn themselves into Consumer Destinations. Jon speaks to thousands annually on his proprietary 14-step “Destination Business” process which he developed after 30+ years of interviewing over 10,000 independent business owners in nearly 600 cities, towns, and downtowns.
Using his Destination strategy, Jon helps independent businesses and communities stand out and draw customers to them, increasing customer traffic from both local consumers and consumers from hundreds of miles away. His process shows businesses how to increase customer counts and revenue (in their businesses and online), all the while increasing a local community’s tax base, a statistic verified by economic development professionals.

In 2002, Jon launched his “Destination Business BootCamp®”, where clients spend two and one-half days in Colorado with him, learning how to reinvent their businesses and marketplaces using his proprietary Destination strategy.

Most recently in 2019, Jon developed the “Destination Creation Course”, an online training that teaches the foundations of a Destination Business, specifically designed for business owners who might never have time to leave their businesses and travel to Colorado. The Destination Creation Course is taught both online and in communities, led by a nationwide network of Certified Facilitators who have been trained by Jon.

Some of Jon’s corporate consulting clients include Kellogg’s, KitchenAid, Bank of America, Denver International Airport, Jiffy Lube, Ace Hardware, Anheuser Busch, Kichler Lighting and Hunter Douglas, to name a few. His insights are frequently seen in national publications such as The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, USA Today, and Entrepreneur Magazine.

Jon is a member of the National Speakers Association and the National Main Street Network.

1211238,,,,Wachs,,,Bryan,,,bryan@mysalesbutler.com,,,,,,,CEO,"Bryan Wachs has a deep history of starting, building, and consulting for a variety of businesses and companies. His approach is focused on customer experience, sales and marketing, technological advances, and providing cohesive growth strategies, and return on investment.

Bryan is a serial entrepreneur who has been involved in numerous ventures, both successful and not. His first foray into business was all about timing as he landed in New York City in 1983 in the early years of MTV music videos and commercials. He worked in the real estate and mortgage industry and was on the team developing the first online loan origination platform, Mortgage Dashboard. He was also the CEO of Eat-inq, a group of nine award-winning restaurants in Aspen, Boulder, and Vail.

Throughout it all, Bryan’s early access to computers in the 1970s allowed him to be on the cutting edge of technology and focused on sales & marketing platforms to grow businesses efficiently and profitably.

In 2000, Bryan refocused his career towards internet marketing and hasn’t looked back. Currently, he leads MySalesButler.com, an internet marketing company. They offer flat-fee internet sales and marketing services to creative agencies, marketers, and software companies to increase their internet marketing skill sets without the overhead or commitments of hiring a full-time person. Bryan is in the process of stepping back his role there to focus on QuikR Stuff.

Bryan is a proud economic development leader in his community. He was instrumental in creating co-working spaces in Avon and Grand Junction, Colorado. Other projects include being a co-founder of WestSlopeStartUpWeek.com and GrandValleyBikeSwap.com, helping farmers evolve via GrandValleyFoodHub.org, volunteering for COPMOBA, and donating time mentoring aspiring entrepreneurs as Entrepreneur-in-Residence at the Maverick Innovation Center at Colorado Mesa University. Bryan also helped organize and was a speaker at TEDxGJ. And he mentors students at the school district’s Career Center. Bryan was recently named Regional Ambassador for CO.STARTERS, which provides community leaders with a set of tools--including resources, mentorship, and education--to help entrepreneurs form and grow companies. 

Bryan’s interest in outdoor recreation drives his passion for living, and helping other like-minded individuals to make a living, in Grand Junction and other rural communities.",true,email,none,,,,,,,,false,,,,,,none,false,en,America/Denver,,4,2020-10-08 18:35:27 UTC,2020-09-14 19:45:37 UTC,2020-09-14 19:59:38 UTC,2020-08-31 14:54:01 UTC,2020-11-30 01:36:16 UTC,true,Entrepreneur,,,with_all,with_all,with_admin,with_admin,with_admin,with_admin,with_all,with_all,with_all,with_all,with_all,false,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Grand Junction, CO, USA",,Grand Junction,,United States,US,Outdoor Recreation,CEO,,,Startup,,,QuikRStuff,,Outdoor Recreation,false,true,false,true,true,false,false,false,false,false,true,false,false,true,,,,,,,,,,,"3550,3671,2315,2720,2721",,900,,,,,"Business Model Canvas, Business Plan Development, Coaching/Mentorship, Industry Connections / Networking, Leadership & Management, Marketing & Promotions, Product/Market Fit, Work / Life Balance","Grand Junction, CO",,,Outoor Recreation,Startup,"Education & training, Funding, Legal, Financial, Mentorship / Coaching, Community Connections, Manufacturing, Marketing"

1384585,,,,Colorado,,,Startup,,,startupco@colorado.edu,,,,,,,,"We believe in the power of rural Colorado

The culture of creativity, resourcefulness, and innovation makes rural Colorado an incredible place to live. It’s also why rural entrepreneurs communities are creating some of the most exciting business opportunities in the state. From the Western Slope to the Eastern Plains, we work alongside our diverse partners to cultivate the growth of entrepreneurs and entrepreneurial communities. Together we foster connectivity and coherence on the playing field - helping startups and small businesses tap into educational, financial, and collaborative resources.

We aim to elevate and support the activities that your local ecosystem builders and business support organizations are already doing 365 days a year.  Where we don’t have population density comparative to our urban hubs, we do have collective action and true collaboration.  This new network platform is proof of our trusted relationships and is built with insights and input from 50 of our closest partners from across the state. 

Startup Colorado is more than a mission, it’s a movement to support your right to start, and it belongs to everyone. 

History of Startup Colorado

At Startup Colorado, our mission is to demonstrate that rural entrepreneurship will ignite a culture of potential, empowering people and places to thrive and define their own future.

Startup Colorado was founded in 2011 by Phil Weiser and Brad Feld  at Silicon Flatirons, which supports entrepreneurship as part of its mission. The initiative initially focused on supporting startups on the Front Range, and the effort to support entrepreneurship across the entire state is the latest evolution of Startup Colorado. Since 2017, Startup Colorado shifted its mission to focus solely on the foundation and success of the State’s rural-based entrepreneurs. 

Led by a team of rural entrepreneurs and ecosystem builders, Startup Colorado works throughout the Western Slope and Eastern Plains; supporting efforts to develop entrepreneurial ecosystems and connect the movers and shakers throughout the state. Our team is on the ground in your neck of the woods, reach out and get to know the people advocating for your hometown.

Our program is funded by the Colorado Office of Economic Development and International Trade, the Foundry Group, Zoma Capital, and Visa. Although our team works remotely in rural Colorado, we are housed in the Silicon Flatirons Center at the University of Colorado Boulder.


How We Work

There’s a lot of noise in the startup world. Instead of adding to it, our carefully honed agenda aims to help the entrepreneurs and community champions actively building for rural Colorado. We do that by:

Making trusted connections for entrepreneurs and community champions within a statewide network of resources including capital, government, educators, and mentors. Fill out our new questionnaire to help us connect you to the right resources.
Providing opportunities for education and networking through individual scholarships and community sponsorships.
Celebrating stories about, and making visible, the people and places who are building for rural Colorado. Read the latest on our blog, and follow us on social.
Endorsing initiatives that benefit the long-term resources and success of Colorado’s rural entrepreneurs.
Fostering greater connectivity and coherence within Colorado’s entrepreneurial ecosystem. ",true,email,none,,,https://twitter.com/StartupColorado,https://www.facebook.com/StartupColoradoOfficial,https://www.instagram.com/startupcolorado_/,https://www.linkedin.com/company/startup-colorado-official,http://www.startupcolorado.org,false,,,,,,none,false,en,America/Denver,,3,2020-10-11 20:49:45 UTC,2020-10-08 15:01:03 UTC,2020-10-08 15:16:46 UTC,2020-10-08 15:00:48 UTC,2020-12-09 12:42:48 UTC,true,Business Support Organization,,,with_all,with_all,with_admin,with_admin,with_admin,with_admin,with_all,with_all,with_all,with_all,with_all,false,false,2450 Kittredge Loop Drive,Wolf Law Building,University of Colorado School of Law,Boulder,CO,80309,US,,,,,,,,"Boulder, CO, USA",,Boulder,,United States,US,"Ecosystem Builder,Nonprofit & Philanthropic",,,,,,,,,,false,true,false,true,true,false,false,false,false,false,true,false,false,true,,,,,,,,,,,,,1285,,,,"Business Model, Funding Models, Fundraising, General Education Support, Organizational Structure, Scaling, Social Impact, Startup Support/Coach",Community Outreach,,,,"Ecosystem Builder, Government & Policy, Media, Nonprofit & Philanthropic, Small Business Support",,Community Connections

I recently began my business and am seeking networking opportunities. However, I am a contrarian marketer, in that I believe marketing helps others first and then realizes their benefits. I grew up and lived many years of my life in Walworth County Wisconsin, around the Geneva Lake area. County life there is part recreation and part agrarian, with a fair mix of small business and industry. In fact, I covered Walworth County as a bureau reporter, mixing in business coverage along with my other beats.  In this aspect, I find Colorado and Wisconsin rather similar. While I live in Denver, I would like to be a part of Colorado's rural entrepreneurship. With my marketing and journalism experience, I have a unique perspective to help members of Startup Colorado as well as the organization itself.

I founded Joke Junction to host open mic events and foster a grassroots comedy scene in Grand Junction. I hope to someday translate the group’s following into a club that gives back to the community by using comedy as a vehicle for mental health education. The inspiration behind this cause isn’t much of a laughing matter but, like many entrepreneurs, I am motivated to solve problems that were born out of my own adversity. I am seeking mentorship/investment... anything to help me take a step forward. I also founded the Maverick I.D.E.A.

I have a passion for working with the small business community in helping them with their HR needs. My superpower is creative (and low cost) recruiting strategies. 

I have a strong-willed toddler that my husband and I love to travel with all over Colorado, especially rural areas. We love the small town shops, the slower pace, and the friendly people. Our favorite areas to frequent are Buena Vista and Salida, Snowmass, and Crested Butte.

HR Branches makes HR affordable and accessible to Colorado small businesses. We provide a turn-key solution for small businesses to self-administer their HR practices, HR Branches Online. HRBO is the most robust HR library built specifically for small businesses - no HR degree required. We ensure all of our pre-built documents, templates, video tutorials, and resources are jargon-free and easy to implement.

1755507,,,,Gonzales,,,Robert,,,speediee83@gmail.com,,,,,,,Creator,"I am the creator of  BETTER LIFE . An idea that has the potential to change and upgrade the way family's live, work, and spend their money through a network system that combines NICE family  rental homes, businesses, career opportunities,  and new technology development plans.   Since 2008 I've been putting together a way for working families to have a nice family sized home to raise their children in and not hafto worry about losing their homes.   I found a way to make a home generate it's own money income.  Therefore the home pays for itself once the home is bought and paid for from the bank.  The home can pay for it's own maintenance, remodeling, and technology upgrades.   This idea is much bigger than what is written here,  this is just the summary.    But imagine  this  a home that pays for itself,  allows the renter to spend there hard earned money in other areas which strengthens the economy.  Also to add to the home through new available technologies I have found a way for Homes to run under their own power.            Now here's the business side.  I want to buy  for sale businesses . Lots of them. So long as each business  has trained professional employees,   a management team,  and for the business to own the property the business sits on.    All these businesses tie in with the rental homes.    Combine the  network of homes and businesses and  you get a company I call BETTER LIFE - which I am actively trying to get off the ground.     Between  the home and business network  there is a plan to remove salt from sea water using new technologies then pump that clean fresh water inland to citys and farmlands throughout Colorado and surrounding states.   This removes the dependency of seasonal snow and rain fall to provide water.          This also has potential to refill lakes and resivors.     Again this is only a summary there was lots of depth and system details left out.   I am here to create the BETTER LIFE network system of rental homes,  businesses,  and new ways of using technology to create a new system to help make a positive change in  everyday family life.",true,email,none,,,,,,,,false,,,,,,none,false,en,America/Phoenix,,10,2020-12-08 04:42:29 UTC,,2020-11-30 04:46:46 UTC,2020-11-24 23:32:25 UTC,2020-12-09 04:57:56 UTC,true,Entrepreneur,,,with_all,with_all,with_admin,with_admin,with_admin,with_admin,with_all,with_all,with_all,with_all,with_all,false,false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Leadville, CO 80461, USA",80461,Leadville,,United States,US,,,,,,,,,,,false,true,false,true,true,false,false,false,false,false,true,false,false,false,,,,,,,,,,,2910,2020-11-24 21:13:01 UTC,155,"I have a network platform I am trying to get off the ground.
